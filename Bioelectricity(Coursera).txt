  Membrane Patches-
    Engine of bioelectricity circuit
    Generators locate in the membrane(sodium-potassium pump)
    A patch consists of about 10~100 pumps(the number able to be studied)
  Trans-membrane voltage(Vm)-To charge:Pumps move the ions into/out of membrane(require external energy)->Pumps leaks out a little potassium
  Sodium-Potassium Pumps-2 Potassium goes inside(P ion removed),3 Sodium goes outside(ATP required)¡BGives diffent voltage
  Ionic equillibrium-
    Nernst for Potassium-
      only potassium ion permeable
      diffusion pushes potassium out(because of membrane temperature)
      electric field pushes potassium ion in
      equillibrium occurs near the Nernst Vm for potassium ion
  ##Nernst Vm=(RT/F)ln(Ke/Ki)=26*ln(20/397)sqid about -77mV(EKNernst equillibrium for Potassium)
    
    Nernst for Sodium-
      only sodium ion permeable
      diffusion pushes Sodium out(because of membrane temperature)
      electric field pushes Sodium ion in
      equillibrium occurs near the Nernst Vm for sodium ion
  ##Nernst Vm=about +57mV(EKNernst equillibrium for Sodium)
    
    Goldman's equation(If no Im)-
      Vm=(RT/F)ln[(Pk*[K]e+PNa*[Na]e+PCl*[Cl]i)/(Pk*[K]i+PNa*[Na]i+PCl*[Cl]e)]¡BP(permeability coefficients)
  
  Battery lifetime-Whole Human Life
  ##Vm shift=ENa-EK 

  Membrane Resistance(Rm)-
    pure lipid bilayer virtually no conductance(infinite resistance)-conductance comes from pumps & channels¡Bconductance goes with open-channel number
  Membrane Conductance-
    Conductors comes mainly from conducting solutions
    Sodium ion has about 4~17 ps
    Potassium ion has about 12~240 ps
  Membrane Capacitance-
    Im=Cm*(dVm/dt)
    It is very big(Because lipid bilayer is thin)
    C=epsilon0*(A/d(thickness))
    paper is 10000 times thicker than membrane
